# Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2025 â€” Team-Elite

**Provisional Project Name**: Automated Specimen Preparation System for testing of Cable samples as per IS 10810 and IS 7098.

This directory contains 3D printable components used in the SIH 2025 adaptation by Team-Elite. Parts may be iterated to align with fixture and preparation workflows for IS 10810 and IS 7098 specimen requirements.

## 3D printing

All the 3D printed parts used in this project.

- `/stl`, same models but in stl format.
- `assembly_model.step`, the full design in `.step` format.

Notes:
- Dimensions and tolerances may be updated to suit cable specimen sizes per IS 10810/IS 7098.
- Keep slicer profiles consistent across iterations to ensure repeatability.
