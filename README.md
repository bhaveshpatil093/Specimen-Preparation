# Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2025 â€” Team-Elite

**Provisional Project Name**: Automated Specimen Preparation System for testing of Cable samples as per IS 10810 and IS 7098.

This repository is currently being adapted and extended by Team-Elite for SIH 2025. The work focuses on automating specimen preparation workflows for cable testing in accordance with IS 10810 and IS 7098. The implementation builds upon and customizes an existing open-source automatic wire stripping and cutting solution.

## Project Background (Upstream Base)

The following sections describe the original project this work is based on, retained here for reference while we integrate SIH-specific functionality and standards compliance.

## Automatic Wire Stripper and Cutter

A 3D printed automatic wire stripper and cutter. You simply choose your measurements on a screen, press a button, and it does it all for you. It will strip the wire and cut the wire depending on the options you chose.

# Arduino

You can find the Arduino sketch in the `/AutoWireCutterStripper` directory.

- Make sure that the i2c address (`#define i2c_Address 0x3c`), corresponds to your OLED display i2c address, which you will find in the datasheet of your OLED display.


## Libraries needed

All these libraries can be easily installed using the Arduino IDE library manager.

- `Stepper` by Arduino.
- `Encoder` by Paul Stoffregen.
- `Adafruit GFX Library` by Adafruit.
- `Adafruit SH110X` by Adafruit.


# Components

# Assembly layout
This is the layout of the components on the board. Use this only for reference on roughly where you should fix the components to the board. I don't suggest using this for exact measurements as you should position the components where it is appropriate for your version of the project.
